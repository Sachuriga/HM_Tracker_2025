"""Drive-coverage checker — a Qt front-end that cross-checks a HexMaze
experiment spreadsheet against what is actually stored on the acquisition
drives.

Workflow:

  1. Browse to the experiment Excel (the ``Raw`` sheet, one row per trial).
     Every unique (subject, day, session, Date) becomes an *expected*
     rat-session, and the ``Implant`` column decides what data it should have:

         Implant == 0  ->  camera video only          (e.g. Rat3 / Rat4)
         Implant == 1  ->  video + ephys pre/task/post (e.g. Rat5 / Rat6)

  2. Browse to up to 4 drive-root folders (data is spread across several
     drives). Each root is laid out as ``Rat<N>_*/<YYYYMMDD>/...`` — the same
     layout ``scan_drive.py`` already understands, whose scanning helpers this
     GUI reuses.

  3. Press *Scan drives*. For every expected rat-session the tool looks for a
     matching ``Rat<N>/<YYYYMMDD>`` folder across all 4 roots and reports which
     data is present and which is MISSING.

  4. Press *Find scattered data* when something comes back MISSING. Step 3 only
     looks directly under the 4 chosen roots; this walks *every* mounted volume
     to a chosen depth, so it finds sessions that were filed somewhere else
     entirely (a backup folder, a per-experimenter folder, a nested copy). It
     reports three ways the drives and the sheet can disagree: data found
     *elsewhere*, data found *nowhere*, and folders on disk the sheet never
     asked for (*orphans*).
